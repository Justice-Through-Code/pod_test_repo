# Pod 1 Ultimate Test Repo!!

Here is the repository where we will be practicing how to collaborate as a team and keep track of documents and changes between our local and remote repos. It is EXTREMELY important to learn these skills because you never want to accidentally overwrite the work of someone else or cause unnecessary conflicts (we will discuss what these are), and with good repo managmeent skills and a shared understanding with all of the group members, there won't be any issues!
