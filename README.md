# Pod 1 Ultimate Test Repo!!

Here is the repository where we will be practicing how to collaborate as a team and keep track of documents and changes between our local and remote repos. It is EXTREMELY important to learn these skills because you never want to accidentally overwrite the work of someone else or cause unnecessary conflicts (we will discuss what these are), and with good repo managmeent skills and a shared understanding with all of the group members, there won't be any issues! 

# To do before each breakout session:

`git pull` on the **main** branch.
- To check which branch you are on, use `git branch`
- To change to main use, `git checkout main`.
- Then you can do `git pull`.

When you pull, you will get all the new files and changes made by our pod. 
You will also be able to find the class challenges in the challenge folder.


# To do after you complete your challenge:

create your own branch. a good branch name is something like this: `aryn-logic`
- `git checkout -b [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]` --> `git checkout -b aryn-logic`

- `git status` -> check for new or modified files
- `git add [FILE NAME]` --> add file so git will track it
- `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"` --> commit file to git
- `git push` --> push it to the repo

- Now go to https://github.com/s-ruby/pod5_repo and find the button to create a pull request.
- Make sure your base is `aryndavis/pod1_test_repo`
- Give a short summary of what you are commiting
- Create Pull Request
