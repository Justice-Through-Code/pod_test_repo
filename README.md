# Pod 5 Test Repo

# To do before each breakout session:

`git pull` on the **main** branch.
- To check which branch you are on, use `git branch`
- To change to main use, `git checkout main`.
- Then you can do `git pull`.

When you pull, you will get all the new files and changes made by our pod. 
You will also be able to find the class challenges in the challenge folder.


# To do after you complete your challenge:

create your own branch. a good branch name is something like this: `serena-strings`
- `git checkout -b [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]` --> `git checkout -b serena-strings`

- `git status` -> check for new or modified files
- `git add [FILE NAME]` --> add file so git will track it
- `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"` --> commit file to git
- `git push` --> push it to the repo

- Now go to https://github.com/s-ruby/pod5_repo and find the button to create a pull request.
- Make sure your base is `s-ruby/pod5_repo`
- Give a short summary of what you are commiting
- Create Pull Request

I will review your pull request, make any comments, and merge it to our main repo!
